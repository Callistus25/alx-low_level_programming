## Low Level Programming - Data Structures, Algorithms, Linux/Unix System Programming ##

This repository contains programs written for the low-level programming and algorithm track at Alx school. In these projects, it covers all about about data structures, algorithms, and other low-level programming concepts while working in `C` langauge. The specific lists of projects contained includes:

- [0x00. C - Hello, World](https://github.com/Callistus25/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x00-hello_world)
- [0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while](https://github.com/Callistus25/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while)
- [0x02. C - Functions, nested loops](https://github.com/Callistus25/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x02-functions_nested_loops)
- [0x03. C - debugging](https://github.com/Callistus25/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x03-debugging)  
- [0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops](https://github.com/Callistus25/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops)
- [0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings the C language](https://github.com/Callistus25/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings)
- [0x06. C - More pointers, arrays and strings]
0x06. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings
0x07. C - Recursion
0x08. C - Static libraries
