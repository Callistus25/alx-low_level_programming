## C - Variables, if, else, while ##

This project is about using arithmetic, logical, relational, and boolean operators in C; declaring and defining variables of type `char`, `int`, and `unsigned int`, using `if` and `if...else` statements, and implementing while loops.

0-positive_or_negative.c: Program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed, and prints whether a randomly generated number is positive or negative, followed by a new line.
- Completion of this [source code](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/rrqNDWjrCWdARnWFLPExPw).
- Stores a different random number every time the program is run.
- Prints the number followed by is positive if the number is greater than 0, is zero if the number is zero, or is negative if the number is less than 0.

1-last_digit.c: program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed and print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.
- You can find the source code [here](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/5HWhPDsq3jq1yCRQFrLl4Q)
- The variable n will store a different value every time the program is run
- Prints the string Last digit of [number] is [last_digit] and is followed by greater than 5 if the digit is greater than 5, 0 if the digit is 0, or less than 6 and not 0 if the digit is less than 6 and not 0.
