## Functions, nested loops

This project shows all i learnt about nested loops, header files, and variable scope in C while practicing declaring and defining my own functions.

- Tests : Folder of test files. 

- Helper File : putchar.c is a fucntion that writes a character to `stdout` 

Header File :

- main.h : Header file containing prototypes for all functions written in the project


Task:

- [0. putchar](https://github.com/Callistus25/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x02-functions_nested_loops/0-putchar.c): C program that prints `_putchar`, followed by a new line. Returns 0.
